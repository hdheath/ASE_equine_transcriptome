# A Comprehensive Allele-Specific Expression Resource for the Equine Transcriptome 

## Abstract
Allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis provides a deep, nuanced view of cis-regulatory mechanisms on gene expression. In this work, we introduce and highlight the significance of an expansive equine ASE database, containing integrated long- and short-read RNA sequencing data along with histone modification insights from four healthy Thoroughbreds (2 mares and 2 stallions), spanning 8 tissues. ASE events were derived from an extensive dataset comprising 121,789 expression quantifications at the SNP locus. After aggregation, this data yielded 70,460 haplotype expression values, resulting in over 35,000 allelic expression comparisons. This valuable publicly accessible resource is poised to drive forward investigations into regulatory variations in equine tissues, fostering a deeper understanding of equine health and disease at the molecular level.
